# su
Saul's Utilities

This is a collection of MATLAB utility functions that many of my other repositories depend on.

All functions start with the lowercase prefix "su".  This is to avoid function name conflicts in light of the fact that MATLAB doesn't have a namespace system outside of their rather non-performant (as of 2015) class implementation.

I am currently running MATLAB 2014B on a Mac.
I do not do any version or platform testing, though I will fix version-specific bugs if they come up.

Please use & abuse.
